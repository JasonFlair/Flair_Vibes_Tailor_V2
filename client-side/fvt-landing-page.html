        <h2>About Flair Vibes Tailor</h2>
        <p>Flair Vibes Tailor was born out of my passion for music and the fact that it is pretty easy to get a little tired of playing the same set of songs over and over. As a music lover, I was always looking for new and exciting songs to add to my playlists. However, I found that most music recommendation algorithms were generic and didn't take into account my personal taste. That's why I decided to create Flair Vibes Tailor, a personalised music recommender that recommends similar songs based on what you submit as your favourite song as your favourite song (or your favourite song at the moment) tells a lot about what you might like to hear.</p>
        <p>I started the development of this project as my Portfolio Project for Holberton School, but I decided to also take it very personal since it ties with my actual interests. You can check out the project repository on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/jasonflair/FlairVibes_Tailor">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Research for this project began around the ending of January/beginning of February, 2022 and then development started on the 10th of February, 2022. Improvements are continous with the aim to make the music recommendations get even better.</p>
        <p>I decided to integrate spotify's API for the recommendations as spotify is arguably the best when it comes to personalised music.</p>
        <p>The entire program for Flair Vibes Tailor was written by myself, Chukwuemelie 'Jason Flair' Obumse.</p>
